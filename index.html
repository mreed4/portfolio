          I I have dabbled off-and-on in web development for about twenty years now, purely at a hobbyist level. My first memory of
          development is in 1999 or so for a personal website about the computer game Counter-Strike.
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of my style or the over-arching themes of my work, I tend to appreciate minimalism [but not ultra-minimalism], negative
          space, typography-forward designs, subtle animations, and simple color palettes. "Less is more" and what not.
        </p>
        <p>
          On a more personal level, I am a millenial California native born and raised in the the Bay Area, though I have spent twenty years
          now in San Diego. I have a fiancee&mdash;Brittni&mdash;and a baby on the way. I enjoy coding, music, good beer, my single speed
          bicycle [it's not a fixie, I swear], and computer games on occasion.
